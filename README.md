# Temperature-converter
The Temperature is generally measured in terms of unit degree., i.e. in degree centigrade, in degrees, Fahrenheit & Kelvin.
Celsius is a standard unit of temperature on the Celsius scale, & is represented by the °C symbol.
Fahrenheit uses the degree Fahrenheit as the unit & is represented with the °F symbol.
Kelvin is an internationally recognized standard for scientific temperature measurement. It is an absolute temperature scale that is obtained by shifting the Celsius scale by −273.15°, in order to coincide the absolute zero to 0K.

# The formula for converting Celsius scale to Fahrenheit scale and Kelvin scale:
T(°F) = (T(°C) * 9)/5 + 32
T(°K) = T(°C) + 273.15

# The formula for converting Fahrenheit scale to Celsius scale and Kelvin scale:
T(°C) = ((T(°F) - 32) * 5) / 9
T(°K) = (T(°F)  - 32) * 5 / 9 + 273.15

# The formula for converting Kelvin scale to Celsius scale and Fahrenheit scale:\
T(°C) = (T(°K) - 273.15
T(°F) = (T(°K) - 273.15) * 9 / 5 + 32;
